    <p>
        John Madden is meaningful to me because he changed football forever—from the way the game is played,
        to how it is taught, to how millions of fans understand it. As a Super Bowl–winning coach,
        a groundbreaking broadcaster, and the face of one of the most influential sports video game
        franchises ever created, Madden made football accessible to everyone. His passion, energy,
        and ability to explain the game shaped generations of players and fans, including me.
